# WebQuest-In-Greece
A WebQuest for elementary students!

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to construct a website. We had to develop an informatics teaching scenario as part of a group assignment for the Didactics of Informatics course. With the help of our expertise in front-end web development, we developed a basic website for elementary school pupils that included a variety of tasks aimed at assessing their ability to conduct searches using search engines.
